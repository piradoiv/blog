Just another fuc*ng weblog system ;)

## Intro

Ten years ago, I've created a weblog system, PHP based, for my personal use. It was really basic (a.k.a. _functional_), it hasn't even a file uploading feature for the images.

Nowadays, on its third version, my personal blog's core could be much improved... I feel lazy to add new posts because its interface is a pain. So I told myself, "hey, what if you create a dedicated programming blog and release the code?".

Here it is.

## Status: Not yet ready

I'm constantly uploading new code to this repository, but I don't have any release ready yet. Stay tunned ;)
